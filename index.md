### Meeting in PJM Lounge - 07/02/18 - 1:00PM

At this meeting I was able to meet the rest of the group that I didnt get to meet on friday. I also made this Github page, which I will update frequently as the group and I work on the project.

### Meeting in G3a, Llandinam - 12/02/18 - 2:00PM

At this meeting we were shown the current state of the project. The project is currently able to load a main menu that has a couple of simple options. It is also able to render a 3 dimensional cube that can be turned by the user. Hui showed us the draft copy of the test specification, I have agreed to look over the test specification and the requirements on blackboard and add anything to the test specification that I believe to be missing.

I have also cloned the git repository to my PC, I informed the other members of the group after a short chat with Robert Jolly. We decided it was a good idea, as there may be a situation where we are not able to access the repository or items may be accidentally removed.
