### Meeting in PJM Lounge - 07/02/18 - 1:00PM

At this meeting I was able to meet the rest of the group that I didnt get to meet on friday. I also made this Github page, which I will update frequently as the group and I work on the project.

## Week beginning 12/02/18

### Meeting in G3a, Llandinam - 12/02/18 - 2:00PM

At this meeting we were shown the current state of the project. The project is currently able to load a main menu that has a couple of simple options. It is also able to render a 3 dimensional cube that can be turned by the user. Hui showed us the draft copy of the test specification, I have agreed to look over the test specification and the requirements on blackboard and add anything to the test specification that I believe to be missing.

I have also cloned the git repository to my PC, I informed the other members of the group after a short chat with Robert Jolly. We decided it was a good idea, as there may be a situation where we are not able to access the repository or items may be accidentally removed.

### Meeting in G3a, Llandinam - 14/02/18 - 3:00PM

Due to having a very important doctors appointment at this date, I was not available to come to this meeting. I have informaed the other members of the group due to my absence. The work I offered to do on the test spec will be done at a later date.

### Free Time, Llandinam - 16/02/18 - 1:00PM

During my free time today, I was able to complete FR7 and FR8 of the test specification. FR7 was the specification on displaying the grid on the screen, while FR8 is the specification on entering words during gameplay. There wasn't anything too complicated about creating specifications for these.

### Group Meeting 16/02/18 - 4:00PM

We went over the method of storing the minutes, which will be changed from being stored on the wiki, to being committed to the git.

## Week beginning 19/02/18
At the start of this week I added Chris Price (cjp) to the repositiry and he has been sent an email explaining so.

### Group Meeting 19/02/18 - 2:00PM
In this group meeting, everyone present went over the test specification and suggested items to add to the specification. Doing this brought to our attention the window size of the game window(s), and whether they should be fixed sizes or resizable by the user. In the end, we decided on the game window not being resizable, at least until we make a final decision as a whole group.

### Group Meeting 21/02/18 - 3:00PM
I did not attend this meeting as I was ill and I woke up late due to my insomnia (I have previiusly seen a doctor about this). I proposed to the group that we reschedule the meeting for a later date, as more than half of us were missing.

### Grouo Meeting 23/02/18 - 4:00PM
This was not an official meeting, as Wayne Aubrey contacted us about his absence. In this meeting we met our new grouo member.
