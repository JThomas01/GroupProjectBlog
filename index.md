### Meeting in PJM Lounge - 07/02/18 - 1:00PM

At this meeting I was able to meet the rest of the group that I didnt get to meet on friday. I also made this Github page, which I will update frequently as the group and I work on the project.

## Week beginning 12/02/18

### Meeting in G3a, Llandinam - 12/02/18 - 2:00PM

At this meeting we were shown the current state of the project. The project is currently able to load a main menu that has a couple of simple options. It is also able to render a 3 dimensional cube that can be turned by the user. Hui showed us the draft copy of the test specification, I have agreed to look over the test specification and the requirements on blackboard and add anything to the test specification that I believe to be missing.

I have also cloned the git repository to my PC, I informed the other members of the group after a short chat with Robert Jolly. We decided it was a good idea, as there may be a situation where we are not able to access the repository or items may be accidentally removed.

### Meeting in G3a, Llandinam - 14/02/18 - 3:00PM

Due to having a very important doctors appointment at this date, I was not available to come to this meeting. I have informaed the other members of the group due to my absence. The work I offered to do on the test spec will be done at a later date.

### Free Time, Llandinam - 16/02/18 - 1:00PM

During my free time today, I was able to complete FR7 and FR8 of the test specification. FR7 was the specification on displaying the grid on the screen, while FR8 is the specification on entering words during gameplay. There wasn't anything too complicated about creating specifications for these.
